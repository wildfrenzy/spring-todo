# Kotlin + Spring Boot Todo List App

### **Learning Kotlin & Spring by building a simple Todo List application**

---

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Todo List application** built with:
- **Kotlin** for the backend logic
- **Spring Boot** for REST API and application structure
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for a simple frontend interface

The goal of this project is to **learn Kotlin and Spring Framework concepts** by implementing a practical application with:
- A REST API for task management
- A simple web UI that communicates with the API
- Clean architecture with service and controller layers

---

## 🔍 Features
✔ Add new tasks  
✔ View all tasks  
✔ Mark tasks as done  
✔ Delete tasks  
✔ Simple web interface using **HTML + JS + Css**  
✔ REST API endpoints

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Kotlin**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Gradle** for build
- **H2 Database** (planned)
- **HTML + JavaScript + CSS** (frontend)

---

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Understand **Spring Boot project structure**  
- Work with **Controllers, Services, and Dependency Injection**  
- Build and consume **REST APIs**  
- Integrate **frontend with API** using JavaScript  
- (Upcoming) Add **database persistence** using **Spring Data JPA**  

---

## 🔗 API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks` – Get all tasks  
- `POST /api/tasks` – Add new task 
- `PATCH /api/task/{id}` – Mark task as done  
- `DELETE /api/task/{id}` – Delete a task

## 🚀 Next Steps
- [ ] Add **database integration** (H2 / JPA)  
- [ ] Implement **multiple Todo lists**  
- [ ] Add **user management**  
- [ ] Improve frontend with **dynamic updates and better UI**
